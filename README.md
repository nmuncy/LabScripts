# LabScripts
Scripts developed for the Kirwan Memory Lab

Update 04/17/19: All scripts will now be on github.com/Kirwanlab/Labscripts, please follow there.

Scripts are organized in the following format:
  "type of script" "step number in pipeline" "brief description"
   So, Task_step0_dcm2nii.sh is the first step in a task-based fMRI pipeline, precedes Task_step1_*, and converts dicom files to nifti.
