# LabScripts
Scripts developed for the Kirwan Memory Lab

Scripts are organized in the following format:
  <type of script>_<step number in pipeline>_<brief description>
   So, Task_step0_dcm2nii.sh is the first step in a task-based fMRI pipeline, precedes Task_step1_*, and converts dicom files to nifti.
